# PLANT-GROWTH-MILESTONE-DASHBORD
## Problem Statement ‼️
Agricultural productivity is heavily influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil type, and fertilizer usage. However, farmers and agricultural planners often lack data-driven insights to understand how these variables impact plant growth milestones. Without such insights, optimizing crop yield and resource allocation becomes challenging.

This project aims to identify and analyze key factors affecting plant growth milestones using interactive visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that help stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance crop performance under varying environmental and soil conditions.
## Objective 🎯
To analyze the impact of environmental factors—such as temperature, humidity, soil type, and fertilizer type—on plant growth milestones using Power BI. The dashboard aims to provide actionable insights that help optimize plant growth conditions and support data-driven decision-making in agriculture.
