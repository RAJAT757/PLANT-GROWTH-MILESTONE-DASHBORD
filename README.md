# PLANT-GROWTH-MILESTONE-DASHBORD
## Problem Statement ‼️
Agricultural productivity is heavily influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil type, and fertilizer usage. However, farmers and agricultural planners often lack data-driven insights to understand how these variables impact plant growth milestones. Without such insights, optimizing crop yield and resource allocation becomes challenging.

This project aims to identify and analyze key factors affecting plant growth milestones using interactive visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that help stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance crop performance under varying environmental and soil conditions.
## Objective 🎯
To analyze the impact of environmental factors—such as temperature, humidity, soil type, and fertilizer type—on plant growth milestones using Power BI. The dashboard aims to provide actionable insights that help optimize plant growth conditions and support data-driven decision-making in agriculture.
## Key Metrics 🔍
Average Temperature:
Displays the mean temperature recorded across all plant growth data.
📌 Value: 25.08°C

Average Humidity:
Indicates the average humidity level influencing plant development.
📌 Value: 58.10%

Total Growth Milestones:
Represents the total number of recorded plant growth achievements.
📌 Value: 193

Growth Milestone Count by Soil Type:
Shows how different soil types (clay, loam, sandy) contribute to plant growth.

Growth Milestone by Fertilizer Type:
Tracks growth success based on fertilizer used (organic, chemical, none).

Humidity by Humidity Level:
Measures average humidity across levels: Humid, Moderate, and Dry.

Temperature by Temperature Range:
Analyzes temperature variations across Warm, Moderate, and Cold conditions.

Key Influencer (Temperature Impact):
Identifies Cold temperature as a major factor reducing overall average temperature by 9.7°C.

Growth Count by Watering Frequency:
Compares growth outcomes based on daily, weekly, and bi-weekly watering schedules.

## Business Problem the Dashboard Solves
🌡️ Difficulty in identifying the ideal temperature and humidity conditions for optimal plant growth.

🌱 Lack of clarity on which soil types support higher growth milestones.

🧪 Uncertainty about the effectiveness of different fertilizer types (organic, chemical, none).

💧 Confusion over the best watering frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly) for maximum plant development.

📉 Absence of data-driven insights leads to inefficient farming practices and inconsistent yield.

📊 Need for a visual tool that consolidates growth factors and highlights patterns and key influencers.

🧠 Limited ability to make informed agricultural decisions without analytical support.
## Recommendations
It is recommended to use organic fertilizers as they show the highest positive impact on plant growth milestones. Clay soil appears to be the most suitable for supporting healthy plant development. Maintaining an average temperature of around 25°C and humidity levels near 58% is ideal for optimal growth.
## Future Outlook🌿
The dashboard can be further enhanced by integrating real-time IoT sensor data for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture to provide dynamic, location-specific insights. Incorporating weather forecasts and satellite imagery could improve predictive accuracy and decision-making. Expanding the dataset to include more plant types, growth stages, and seasonal trends will make the analysis more robust. Additionally, deploying the dashboard as a mobile or web app can help farmers access insights on the go, enabling timely and data-driven interventions in agricultural practices.
